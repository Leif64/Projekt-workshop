        <h2>Welcome To Donkiramen</h2>
        <p>Everyone who loves Japanese food will know what Ramen is, but Donki is a different type of ramen.</p>
        <p>The noodles and soup are served separately, and the noodles are to be dipped and slurped.</p>
        <p>Our soup is simmered for over 30 hours to create the rich thickness and depth of flavor.</p>
        <p>The noodles are custom-made to be bouncy, which is a perfect match to entangle with the soup.</p>
        <p>Established in Kuwait, but the flavor and love has been carried out into the world. 
        <p>to share our ‘Bond’ with everyone who comes through our doors.</p>
